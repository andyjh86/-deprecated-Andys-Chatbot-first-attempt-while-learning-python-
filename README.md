# Andys-Chatbot
An incredibly basic chat bot using a pretrained model in a basic GUI. Created as a proof of concept to learn Python
Pretrained language model can be changed from model_name in line 7. GPT-NEO would be interesting but my computer has as much power as a potato
Rather than save pretrained model in .chache it will save them in C:/Zoo
A .csv file is created (C:/Zoo/Votes/vote.csv) which records all downvoted and upvoted responses. A filter stops the bot from responding with the same downvoted response twice.
